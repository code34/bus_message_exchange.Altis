Messages are variables that contains value, and are send to destination host.

How to send message:
--------------------
Usage:
[message, destination] call BME_fnc_publicvariable;

Send a message to all client
["variablename", "client"] call BME_fnc_publicvariable;
	
Send a message to a specific client
["variablename", "client", clientid] call BME_fnc_publicvariable;

Send a message to server
["variablename", "server"] call BME_fnc_publicvariable;
	
Send a message to everybody
["variablename"] call BME_fnc_publicvariable;

How to receive message:
-----------------------
The message are handle by listeners on client or server side. Listeners are specific functions that are executed on destination host, when message is distributed.
Message is distributed as a parameter of the function like eventhandler do.

There is tow kind of listeners:
- server listeners 
- client listerners 

The listener declaration must respect this syntax:
BME_netcode_server_nameofyourvariable = { code to execute on server side };
BME_netcode_nameofyourvariable = { code to execute on client side };

You can declare thoses listeners directly on your code, but it's more simple to use the default location:
client side:
- declare by default in BME_clienthandler.sqf

server side:
- declare by default in BME_serverhandler.sqf
